      <h3>No advertising</h3>

      <p>There's no ads on <a href="/">Picture</a>, your attention or your
      pictures are not the product. You are our customers. The service we
      offer you is hosting your picture.</p>

      <h3>One simple price</h3>

      <p>Hosting providers charge, on average, about $0.10 per GB of data
      stored or transferred per month. On top of that we need to add compute
      costs, payment processing fees, taxes, and developer time, which add up
      to about <strong>$1.00 per GB</strong> to make it sustainable.</p>

      <p class="display-4 my-5 text-center text-muted">
        $1.00 per GB<br>
        of data stored<br>
        or transferred
      </p>

      <p>We measure the data transferred by monitoring every picture downloaded.
      And at the end of the month we measure how much space your pictures are
      taking on our servers.</p>

      <h3>Free trial</h3>

      <p>When you sign up you will be given <strong>100MB of data for
      free</strong> to test the service. No credit card required. After that
      you will have to top up your account balance to keep uploading new
      pictures.</p>

      <h3>No termination fee</h3>

      <p>You can stop topping up your account balance any time. If it becomes
      negative you will not be able to upload anymore, and your account may be
      temporarily disabled.</p>

      <h3>Host your own instance</h3>

      <p>If you have a lot of pictures or are experiencing a lot of traffic,
      our service costs might be too much for you. The good news is that <a
      href="/">Picture</a> is <strong>open source</strong>, so you can always
      host your own instance!</p>
